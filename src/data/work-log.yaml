        - I went through three interviews, one on UMN campus with a Daugherty recruiter, and two in person at the office, first with a regular software engineer, a manager and another recruiter, and the second with a senior application architect.
        - I am consultant &numero; 101 at this branch.
        - I work in the Kitchen.
