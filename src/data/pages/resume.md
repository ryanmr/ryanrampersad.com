Follow me on Twitter [@ryanmr](https://twitter.com/ryanmr?resume).

I work at Daugherty as a **Senior Consultant and Application Architect**. My primary role is software engineering with a fullstack approach and pragmatic philosophy. Beyond that, I help business teams thrive with technology, build engineering teams focused on growth and autonomy, and lend an engineering perspective to management and its pedestrian duties. If you are interested in more details, please read the [historical record of my work](/history).

### Breakdown

I have experience with the following to varying levels. I consider these buzzwords and basically meaningless without the context of the projects. Despite that, some organizations believe buzzwords buy sales &mdash; read the following buzzwords as an exercise in asking useful questions.

### Other


### Education

I graduated from the University of Minnesota in 2015 with a Bachelors of Computer Science. In the Computer Science program, I was on the _Software Engineering_, _Systems_ and _Compilers_ track.

My original intent was leaning towards more web developer inclined coursework, but I was lucky enough to expand my horizons and come to love _compilers_ and _systems_.

### The Nexus

In 2011, I founded my [own small podcast network](http://thenexus.tv) and built my own small in-house podcasting studio. As of late 2020, we have recorded just over 1300 episodes across various series.

### Previous work

#### Saint Paul Public Schools

Previous work during college.

I helped instructors teach various Saint Paul Public Schools Community Education classes, such as Computer Basics 101, 201, Excel, PowerPoint and more. I also taught iterations of my own Website Basics and Website Construction classes, which focused on writing HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript by hand.
