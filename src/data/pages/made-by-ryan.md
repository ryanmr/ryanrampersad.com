#### Tech

This site uses Gatsby as its static site generator. Gatsby offers the best-in-class pattern for building on the web today. React provides the component based composition pattern that makes interface building a breeze. Styled Components addresses modern styling needs with capabilities for optimized bundles.

#### Font

[League Gothic](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic). Uppercased, text looks handsome and proud, but lean and agile. Featured as my name.

#### Ribbon

I was inspired by [Evan You's](http://evanyou.me/) canvas effect. While it is no longer used on his website, I keep an _as-was_ code copy of the original effect [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/ryanmr/205ef4297e7821fad088).

Based on the concept of those _triangles_ <span title="Ã  la growth">climbing from left to right</span>, I added additional extensions like _red_ for _branding_ and <span title="aeternus et umquam">the _motion_</span>.
