I work at Daugherty as **Senior Software Engineer and Architect** and as **Senior Consultant**. 

My primary role is software engineering with a fullstack approach and pragmatic philosophy. Beyond that, I help business teams thrive with technology, build engineering teams focused on growth and autonomy, and lend an engineering perspective to management and its pedestrian duties. If you are interested in more details, please read the [historical record of my work](/history).

### _Whatever I want_

> Anyway if you want to pay me the same or more to do whatever I want to do without performance reviews then, my direct messages are open.
