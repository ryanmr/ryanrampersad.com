For [over a decade](https://github.com/ryanmr?bio), I have followed
emerging technologies and trends and written code for fun and profit. I
graduated from the University of Minnesota &mdash; Twin Cities with a
Bachelors of Computer Science, with a focus on software engineering,
systems and compilers. While at the _U of M_, I founded my [podcasting
network](https://thenexus.tv?bio), and since then we have recorded more
than 1300 episodes. I [love my work](/history?bio) as a principal software engineer.
