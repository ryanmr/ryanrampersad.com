Hi, Ryan here. Here are some details about this site and the brand overall.

### Tech

* [Astro](https://astro.build/)
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### Color

The primary color palette is "white" on black, with a a mix of stone shaded grays in-between.

* `#ff0000`
* `#181818`
* `#efefef`
* `#0080ff`

### Font

The _signature_ font is League Gothic. While uppercased, it stands handsome and proud yet remains lean and agile.

### Ribbon


I was inspired by [Evan You's](http://evanyou.me/) original canvas effect. While it is no longer used on his website, I keep an as-was code copy of the original effect [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/ryanmr/205ef4297e7821fad088). Today's version significantly deviates from the original.

### Branding

The branding is designed to be sleek though exuberant. The signature font is bold and captivating. The red is confident with quiet intensity. The blue is reminiscent of the cloudy sky. The _black_ is the expanse and the mastermind.

The triangles climb from the lower left to the upper left, inspired by our endless march towards growth. But it's not guaranteed. The movement is subtle and enduring and represents <dfn title="forever and ever">aeternus et umquam</dfn>. Finally, the _ribbon_ is an homage to [the threads of fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fates#:~:text=The%20Fates%20are%20a%20common,weaving%20threads%20on%20a%20loom.).
