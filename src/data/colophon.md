Hi, Ryan here. Here are some details about this site and the brand overall.

### Source

You can [read the source for this site on Github](https://github.com/ryanmr/ryanrampersad.com). Historically, this has lived on Github and Gitlab in various versions.

### Color

The base palette is "white" on "black", with a mix of stone shaded grays in-between. Plus `red` and `azure`.

### Font

The _signature_ font is League Gothic. While set in uppercase, it stands handsome and proud yet remains lean and agile.

### Ribbon


I was inspired by [Evan You's](https://evanyou.me/) original canvas effect. While it is no longer used on his website, I keep an as-was code copy of the original effect [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/ryanmr/205ef4297e7821fad088). Today's version significantly deviates from the original.

### Branding

The branding is designed to be sleek though exuberant. The signature font is bold and captivating. The _red_ is confident with quiet intensity. The _blue_ is reminiscent of the cloudy sky. The _black_ is the expanse and the mastermind.

the _ribbon_ is an homage to [the threads of fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fates#:~:text=The%20Fates%20are%20a%20common,weaving%20threads%20on%20a%20loom.). The triangles climb from the lower left to the upper left, inspired by our endless march towards growth. But it's not guaranteed. The movement is subtle, enduring, and represents <span class="underline decoration-dotted italic" title="forever and ever">aeternus et umquam</span>.
