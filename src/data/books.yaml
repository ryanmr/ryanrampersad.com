- title: "An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management"
  author: "Will Larson"
  note: |
    I think I learned of this book through the occasional HackerNews book thread. Entering into a pseudo-management position at the time, it caught my eye. During my reading of _An Elegant Puzzle_, I felt philosophical alignment with Larson, while at times I think he stretched his advise too far and left the argument hanging without a conclusion or justification. Definitely a recommended read for intermediate and senior engineers, and of course those looking towards management. Finally, all of this is to say nothing of its well made printing âˆ’ Stripe Press has gone out of its way to make a beautiful hardcover, with many full color pages, on thick paper stock.

- title: "The Systems Bible: The Beginner's Guide to Systems Large and Small Paperback"
  author: "John Gall"
  note: |
    The Systems Bible is a strange book, in my opinion. It uses irony, exageration and some mix of satire and parody to portray how complexity piles up in systems and what that means.

- title: "The Rust Programming Language"
  author: "Steve Klabnik"
  note: |
    Rust's entire "introduction to rust" book is available online for free, but it is great having that in _physical book_ format. For my purposes, it serves more as a reference to various examples I use to base specific implementations, or to refer to terms to search for elsewhere.

- title: "The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition"
  author: "Don Norman"
  note: |
    As a part of a college reading list for a human computer interaction focused course, The Design of Everyday Things tells the story about the human factor in _design_. Norman explores core tenets of design, affordances, signifiers, mappings and more. While obviously aimed towards frontend inclined engineers, backend engineers may benefit being exposed to this mode of thinking.
