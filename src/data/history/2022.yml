        - Created a poc for testing Okta token exchange
             - For internal organizational reasons, there is an existing issuer and a new issuer
             - The POC was a minimal reproduction of multiple codebases (authentication packages, application deployments)
             - The POC demonstrated token acquisition with the existing issuer, and how the exchange works with the same issuer origin, but fails with a new issuer origin
             - The POC was documented with a consumable README so that it could run other machines and reproduce the findings as well
