            - Hypothesized that "sql-as-the-interface" was critical for reporting purposes
            - Proposed that existing integrating routes were insufficient
            - Explored an alterative method: adhoc creation of SQLite databases mirroring the schema and select rows from the parent data set
            - Shared findings with broader team and discussed ramifications of the approach
            - Used this as an opportunity to use ChatGPT Enterprise code generation
