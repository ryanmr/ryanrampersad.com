                Reading <i>books</i> is a great way to cut throught the endless
                sea of poorly written and unfocused articles online. They're
                curated, edited and maybe even coherent. Beyond learning "how to
                code", many high level pursuits, software engineering,
                arcitecture, management, principles, philosophy âˆ’ these are
                often best found in <i>books</i>.
                <br />
                <br />
                It is not lost on me though, that despite increasingly searching
                out for these options, many go unfinished. Despite that, those
                books listed here are essentially recommended.
                <br />
                <br />
                Hopefully through these recommendedations, you can share in some
                of my favorite sources of knowledge around these topics.
                <br />
