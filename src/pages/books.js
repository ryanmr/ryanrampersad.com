              Reading <i>books</i> is a great way to cut throught the endless
              sea of poorly written and unfocused articles online. They're
              curated, edited and maybe even coherent. Beyond learning "how to
              code", many high level pursuits, software engineering,
              arcitecture, management, principles, philosophy âˆ’ these are often
              best found in <i>books</i>.
              <br />
              <br />
              It is not lost on me though, that despite increasingly searching
              out for these options, many go unfinished. Despite that, those
              books listed here are essentially recommended.
              <br />
              <br />
              Hopefully through these recommendedations, you can share in some
              of my favorite sources of knowledge around these topics.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you have a wonderful book recommendation for me,{" "}
