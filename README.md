===================

Welcome to the Ryan Rampersad static site! I periodically update the site with my resume, work history and accomplishments, referral links, links to my other homes online and more.

## Tech

This static site is generated by the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/). I built the Hugo theme specifically for my needs: easy for others to navigate and read, and easy for me to update.

There is no other special tech required for this site, JavaScript or otherwise. It is entirely self contained.

## Hosting

This site, [ryanrampersad.com](https://ryanrampersad.com?gitlab), is hosted by my excellent [Linode VPS](https://adept.work/refln).

Currently, the site is hosted among my other sites, through a multihost apache configuration with Let's Encrypt enabled.

## Build and Deploy

This site is built and deployed with the wonderfully free tool, Gitlab CI/CD. With Gitlab CI/CD, any push to `master` is built and then deployed within moments to my personal VPS.
