- my education at the University of Minnesota
- my places of employment, and roles
- my notable side projects
- my skillset &mdash; a list of technologies I have been exposed to and used
  - a set of buzzwords without context, please inquire

*Protip:* if you are recruiter, you get bonus points if you follow me and ping me [@ryanmr](https://twitter.com/ryanmr?recruiter).

### Education

I graduated from the University of Minnesota in 2015 with a Bachelors of Computer Science. In the Computer Science program, I was on the *Software Engineering*, *Systems* and *Compilers* track.

My original intent was leaning towards more web developer inclined coursework, but I was lucky enough to expand my horizons and come to love *compilers* and *systems*.

### Work Experience

#### Daugherty

I am a Consultant and Software Engineer 2 at Daugherty. My primary role is software engineering with a fullstack approach, and also consulting internal and external clients.

A [historical record of my work]({{< relref "work-daugherty.md" >}}) at Daugherty is available.
#### Saint Paul Public Schools

I helped instructors teach various Saint Paul Public Schools Community Education classes, such as Computer Basics 101, 201, Excel, PowerPoint and more. I also taught iterations of my own Website Basics and Website Construction classes, which focused on writing HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript by hand.

##### The Nexus

In 2011, I founded my [own small podcast network](http://thenexus.tv) and built my own small in-house podcasting studio. As of late 2017, I have recorded just over 650 episodes across various series.

During that same time, I have iterated upon the customized WordPress installation that powers the network content management system. Since early 2015, I have built prototypes of a successor Content Management System replacement in PHP with Laravel and Java with Spring Boot.

### Breakdown

I have experience with the following to varying levels. I consider these buzzwords and basically meaningless without the context of the projects. Despite that, some organizations believe buzzwords buy sales &mdash; read the following buzzwords as an exercise in asking useful questions. I cannot share details publically about the projects that used these specific technologies, but in confidence I may speak more about them privately.
