### Education

I graduated from the University of Minnesota in 2015 with a Bachelors of Computer Science. In the computer science program, I was on the *software engineering*, *systems* and *compilers* track.

My original intent was leaning towards more web developer inclined coursework, but I was lucky enough to expand my horizons and come to love *systems* and *compilers*.

### Experience

I helped instructors teach various Saint Paul Public Schools Community Education classes, such as Computer Basics 101, 201, Excel, PowerPoint and more. I also taught iterations of my own Website Basics and Website Construction classes, which focused on writing HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript by hand.

### Projects

##### Android App (In Class)

For 5115 User Interface Design, I lead my team of five in the group development of an Android app implementing the then-recently released Material Design specification, that would read SMS out loud based on contextual settings such as WiFi network, location, time and more.

##### The Nexus

In 2011, I founded my own small podcast network and built my own small in-house podcasting studio. As of early 2016, I have recorded just over 500 episodes across various series.

During that same time, I have iterated upon the customized WordPress installation that powers the network content management system.

##### WarGame

The WarGame is a multi-language implementation of the card game *War*. It functions as a *kinda-sorta* benchmark. It is implemented in each language using native constructs and attempts to follow best practices. Currently, it is implemented with Rust, Go and Java. [Visit the project on GitHub](https://github.com/WarGameBenchmarks).
