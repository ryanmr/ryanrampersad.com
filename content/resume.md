### Education

I graduated from the University of Minnesota in 2015 with a Bachelors of Computer Science. In the computer science program, I was on the *software engineering*, *systems* and *compilers* track.

My original intent was leaning towards more web developer inclined coursework, but I was lucky enough to expand my horizons and come to love *systems* and *compilers*.

### Work Experience

#### Daugherty

I am an Consultant / Software Engineer 2 at Daugherty. My primary role besides acting as a consulting for client projects, is software development.

#### Saint Paul Public Schools

I helped instructors teach various Saint Paul Public Schools Community Education classes, such as Computer Basics 101, 201, Excel, PowerPoint and more. I also taught iterations of my own Website Basics and Website Construction classes, which focused on writing HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript by hand.

##### The Nexus

In 2011, I founded my own small podcast network and built my own small in-house podcasting studio. As of early 2017, I have recorded just over 550 episodes across various series.

During that same time, I have iterated upon the customized WordPress installation that powers the network content management system.
