### Hugo

I made this website with the [Hugo static site generator](http://gohugo.io).

This has benefits!

- it is *not* WordPress
- it is like a *content management system*, but without the overhead
- adding pages with customized layouts is easy, `hugo new page.md`; and it's written in markdown
- the template engine is fairly great in my opinion

It has a couple downsides.

- while possible, it is not in good practice to keep other contents in the same `www/` directory, and thus other sub-projects cannot be contained here (which is fine, because those have [another home anyway](http://ifupdown.com))
- when the next *big thing* comes around, pushing Hugo's generated pages into a folder and linking back to it might be troublesome

Despite those downsides, I think Hugo is great for making a portfolio and landing page, and its associated pages.

#### Font

My favorite title font is the overused [League Gothic](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic). Uppercased, text looks handsome and proud, but lean and agile.

#### Script

Any homepage needs a gimmick and while it pains to me to do so, I adopted [Evan You's fancy background canvas generator](http://evanyou.me/). I happen to like the color red right now, so there you go. The [not invented here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) syndrome kicks in hard nevertheless. Needless to say, I will be tinkering and updating how it works for the foreseeable future because it is just so fantastic.

#### Last Notes

This entire description could have been a blog post, but it makes sense to keep the materials about this little site together. Thanks for reading.
