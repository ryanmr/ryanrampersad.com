You can visit the [Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/ryanmr/ryanrampersad.com). Changes are pushed to the repository, built by Gitlab and finally, deployed here.

#### Hugo

I made this website with the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io). It's easier to manage the primarily static design and content from Gitlab rather than working through something like WordPress.

#### Fonts

[League Gothic](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic). Uppercased, text looks handsome and proud, but lean and agile.

#### Scripts

I adopted [Evan You's](http://evanyou.me/) [canvas effect](https://gist.github.com/ryanmr/205ef4297e7821fad088). I made the script a bit more extensible with my own tweaks, and I added the _motion_.

No addditional scripts are present.

#### Styles

I use [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)'s Flex Grids and button designs.
