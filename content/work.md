Beginning March 28th, 2016, I began working at [Daugherty Business Solutions](https://www.daugherty.com/) as an Associate Consultant / Software Engineer 1.

I work in the [Minneapolis / Saint Paul branch](https://www.daugherty.com/about-us/locations/minneapolis/), while I still continue to live at home -- [the commute is just fine](http://adept.work/daughertyroute).

Here's [a tiny album](https://goo.gl/photos/XHFAkCFaUq9wGX7B6) of my office and my desk from my first week at Daugherty.

#### Amusements (from Week 1)

- Daugherty's recruiter team found me at the UMN CSE Career Fair.
- I went through three interviews, one on UMN campus, and two in person at the office.
- I am consultant #101 at this branch!
- I work in the Kitchen.

#### Two final notes:

1. If you have an interest in Daugherty, let me know. Apparently, you can get a referral, and we all win.
2. So we are all clear, all thoughts are my own, especially the good thoughts, and do not represent Daugherty.
