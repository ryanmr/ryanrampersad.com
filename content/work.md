### Work Updates

- Working on a brief 5 week project, in a group of three team members
- I attended the University of Minnesota CSE Job Fair to recruit soon-to-graduate students

#### August: <small>Week 21</small>

#### July: <small>Week 14</small>

- I built various command line utilities for the team using `npm`, `gulp`, `browserify`, `sass` and more, to compile our growing client-side web application.
- I configured a new team virtual machine pre-configured with our development stack: IntelliJ, MySQL, Java, and more, built on top of Xubuntu 16.04.
- Over the last few weeks, I led the *Accelerator 2.0* program &mdash; the training program Daugherty uses to on-board new hires, hosting an example project for a great group of three recent college graduates.

#### Late May: <small>Week 9</small>

- I have been working on designing back-end service layers for the foundation of a RESTful API for what will eventually be an Account Management type of service.

#### Early May: <small>Week 5</small>

##### Two final notes:

1. If you have an interest in Daugherty, let me know. Apparently, you can get a referral, and we all win.
2. So we are all clear, all thoughts are my own, especially the good thoughts, and do not represent Daugherty.
